### Framing Participant Analysis
This package provides functions that extract linguistic information from a corpus of reference texts grouped under the same incident and perform a frame semantic analysis of the referenced participants over time. Specifically, the package provides distribution over time of in-text mentions that are linked to structured data, and it provides a distribution of the frames with which the same mentions are annotated.

This package was built and used for the purpose of a thesis Chapter titled "Variation in Framing at Participant Level".

### Prerequisites
Python 3.7.4 was used to create this package. It might work with older versions of Python.

### Resources
A number of GitHub repositories need to be cloned and adapted with novel data. This can be done calling:
```bash
bash install.sh
```

### Python modules
A number of external modules need to be installed, which are listed in **requirements.txt**.
Depending on how you installed Python, you can probably install the requirements using one of following commands:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
This package comes with different main functions:

# Extract frame semantic information from FramInc corpus
The function framing_an_incident_per_doc() extracts linguistic information from the annotated NAF files (the FramInc corpus) in the DFNDataReleases repository. You can run the function with the following command:

```python
from incident_analysis import framing_an_incident_per_doc, dir_path
from datetime import datetime
import json

with open('../DFNDataReleases/structured/inc2lang2doc2subevents.json', "r") as infile:
    subevents_dict = json.load(infile)

utrecht_shooting = "Q62090804"
utrecht_shooting_date = datetime(2019,3,18)

framing_an_incident_per_doc(project="test_release",
                            incident=utrecht_shooting,
                            language="nl",
                            event_date=utrecht_shooting_date,
                            subevents_dict=subevents_dict,
                            output_folder=dir_path,
                            start_from_scratch=False,
                            verbose=1)
```
The following parameters are specified:
* **project** the label of the research project
* **incident** the wikidata identifier of the incident
* **language** the language in which the reference texts are overwritten
* **event_date** the date on which the incident occurred.
* **subevents_dict** a dictionary that links a selection of mentions in FramInc to the incident ID, as a means of post-annotation curation.
* **output_folder** the path to the current package. The helper functions will use this path to create new folders to which extracted data will be exported.
* **start_from_scratch**: if True, remove all existing output
* **verbose**: 1: descriptive stats 2: more stats 3: lots of stats

After running the example, you observe an **output** folder in this directory. Its nested structure is as follows:

output
  WIKIDATA_ID
    corpus
      LANGUAGE
        *.json

Run the python script test_framing_per_doc.py in the **test** folder to extract and export the information from all four incidents in FramInc in English and Dutch to the output folder.

# Plot timeline
The function plot_timeline() takes the json files from a specified incident and exports a plot of publication dates. You can run the function with the following command:

```python
from participant_analysis import plot_timeline, dir_path

plot_timeline(incident=utrecht_shooting,
                output_folder=dir_path,
                start_from_scratch=False,
                verbose=1)
```
The following parameters are specified:
* **incident** the wikidata identifier of the incident
* **output_folder** the path to the current package. The helper functions will use this path to create new folders to which extracted data will be exported.
* **start_from_scratch**: if True, remove all existing output
* **verbose**: 1: print path to which the plot is exported.

After running the example, you will find a timeline.PDF in the WIKIDATA_ID subfolder of **output**.

Run the python script test_plot_timeline.py in the **test** folder to plot the timelines of all four incidents in FramInc.
